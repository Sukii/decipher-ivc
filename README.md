# Decipherment of Indus Valley Script


*S.K.Venkatesan*


The Indus Valley Script is a logo-syllabic script and has been mostly deciphered. We list a few of the keys to unlock the treasure of the Indus Valley. We refer to M77 and DED below as:

1. M77 is [Mahadevan's numbering system](https://indusscript.in/)
2. DED is [Dravidian Entymology Dictionary](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/)

You can also get them through the Internet Archive as ebooks:
