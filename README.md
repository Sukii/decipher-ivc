# Decipherment of Indus Valley Script


*S.K.Venkatesan*


The Indus Valley Script is a logo-syllabic script and has been mostly deciphered. We list a few of the keys to unlock the treasure of the Indus Valley. We refer to M77 and DED below as:

1. M77 is [Mahadevan's numbering system](https://indusscript.in/)
2. DED is [Dravidian Entymology Dictionary](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/)

You can also get them through the Internet Archive as ebooks:

1. [MASI 77 Indus Script Texts Concordances & Tables](https://archive.org/details/masi77indusscripttextsconcordancestablesiravathammahadevan_410_D)
2. [A Dravidian etymological dictionary by Burrow &amp; Emaneau](https://archive.org/details/dravidianetymolo0000burr_u1k6/mode/2up)

We also provide just the pages for M77 sign list:

1. [M77 sign list](M77-sign-list.pdf)
2. [Variants in M77 sign list](M77-variants.pdf)
